# Medical-Chatbot-Using-NLP: Overview
Purpose
This project implements a chatbot designed to assist users with medical queries. It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand user input about symptoms, extract relevant medical information, and suggest possible diseases or conditions. It also provides explanations about diseases, symptoms, causes, treatments, and preventive measures.

Key Features
Symptom Extraction:
The chatbot can process free-form user input, identify symptoms mentioned in the text, and match them to known medical symptoms.

Disease Prediction:
By analyzing the extracted symptoms, the chatbot uses either trained models or a symptom database to present a list of possible diseases or conditions that match the user's input.

Medical Knowledge Base:
The chatbot contains information on:

Diseases
Symptoms
Causes
Treatments
Preventive measures
Conversational Interface:
Users interact with the bot in natural language, simulating a conversation with a virtual medical assistant.

NLP Techniques Used:

Text preprocessing (tokenization, stemming, etc.)
Named Entity Recognition (for symptom extraction)
Possibly intent recognition
Classification or matching algorithms for disease suggestion
Typical Workflow
User Input:
User types a medical question or describes symptoms in natural language.

NLP Pipeline:
The input is processed to extract meaningful information (e.g., symptoms).

Database/Model Query:
The bot consults its symptom-disease database or prediction model to find relevant information.

Response Generation:
The chatbot replies with possible diagnoses and explains details about the disease, symptoms, causes, etc.

Use Cases
Initial triage: Help users determine if they should see a doctor.
Medical education: Provide quick information about diseases.
Patient engagement: Answer questions about symptoms and treatments.
What This Repository Is (and Is Not)
Is: A proof-of-concept or educational implementation of an NLP-powered medical chatbot.
Is Not: A replacement for a real doctor or clinical decision support system. It is not intended for emergency or critical diagnostic use.
